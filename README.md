# ðŸ‘¤ NascentCyborg  

Exploring reflective system architectures, cognition-as-code, and design principles for emergent intelligence.  

Repositories here serve as testbeds for new heuristics â€” Resonance Bench, Hourglass Vortex, Iterative Sovereignty Method, Emotional Calculus, and Relational Topography.  

Not software *alone*, but signal experiments: code, concepts, and cultural hacks aligned for coherence.
